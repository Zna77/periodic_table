# Periodic Table of Elements Design

This is a project I created to showcase my HTML and CSS skills. It's a visually appealing design of the periodic table of elements, inspired by the classic design but with a modern twist.

## Features

- Interactive hover effects to display the name and atomic number of each element
- Color-coded categories to help with element classification
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for the page structure
- CSS3 for the styling and layout
- Google Fonts for custom typography

## How to Use

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the periodic table of elements. Hover over any element to see its name and atomic number.

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun working on this project and learned a lot about HTML and CSS in the process. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
